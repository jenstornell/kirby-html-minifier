Use one of the alternatives below.

### 1. Kirby CLI

```text
$ cd path/to/kirby
$ kirby plugin:install jenstornell/kirby-html-minifier
```

### 2. Clone or download

1. [Clone](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-html-minifier.git) or [download](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-html-minifier/archive/master.zip)  this repository.
2. Unzip the archive if needed and rename the folder to `kirby-html-minifier`.

**Make sure that the plugin folder structure looks like this:**

```text
site/plugins/kirby-html-minifier/
```

### 3. Git Submodule

If you know your way around Git, you can download this plugin as a submodule:

```text
$ cd path/to/kirby
$ git submodule add https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-html-minifier site/plugins/kirby-html-minifier
```

When the plugin is successfully installed, your html code should be minified.

## Options

```php
c::set('plugin.html.minifier.active', true);
c::get('plugin.html.minifier.options',[]);
c::get('plugin.html.minifier.blacklist', []);
```

## active

It's active by default but it's possible to turn it off. It's especially useful with [multi environmental setup](https://getkirby.com/docs/developer-guide/configuration/options#multi-environment-setup).

```php
c::set('plugin.html.minifier.active', true);
```

## options
If you are a hardcore user you can use the options of the `Minify_HTML` class.

```php
c::get('plugin.html.minifier.options', []);
```

Read about the options in the [code](https://github.com/mrclay/minify/blob/master/lib/Minify/HTML.php#L69).

## blacklist

You can disable pages from being minified by adding page id(s) as a string or an array. Every child to that page will be disabled as well.

**Example**

```php
c::get('plugin.html.minifier.blacklist', ['about', 'projects']);
```
